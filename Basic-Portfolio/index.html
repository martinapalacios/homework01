            <p>Hello to all expert/new developers! I’m a novice at this so please be patient with me as I will be asking for tons of assistance. Currently I’m employed at one of the top civil engineering firms here in this great sprawling city of H-town, city with no limits!</p>


            <p>I’m a GIS Analyst which stands for Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I use ESRI's software to analyzing spatial data. By using this software I create digital maps from geographic data. My main priorities are the submittal of utility data so that city municipalities can incorporate them into there system as well as any base map information which includes; Parcels, ROW, Street Centerlines, Easements, Light Poles and anything that you see above or below ground. I enrolled in this bootcamp class to further my MAP making skills so that I can present precise digital information in web apps.</p>
